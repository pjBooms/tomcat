## About This Fork

This fork allows Tomcat web applications to be written and run as Jigsaw modules!
If you put all your dependencies (including your own classes that have to be packed as a modular jar) into `/WEB-INF/modules`
of the resulting WAR file instead of `/WEB-INF/lib` then the jars will be loaded as Jigsaw modules.
Thus `/WEB-INF/modules` stands for complete analog of `--module-path` for web applications.
Note, that jars from `/WEB-INF/lib` are loaded in Unnamed Jigsaw module (regardless of this fork),
thus it is a complete analog of `-cp` for web applications.
So with this fork you can follow the same migration path as suggested by Jigsaw for `-classpath` applications,
gradually moving jars form `/WEB-INF/lib` to `/WEB-INF/modules` modularising your web application this way.

You may try my modular web application example with the fork to see that it actually works:
